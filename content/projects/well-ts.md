description = "You know well plates? I have seen people printing layouts of them and the scribbling concentration values on them? Is that intuitive? Not at all. Is that a waste of paper? Yes. And then on top of that if you were to make a presentation of the well plates you would need to know photoshop and all sorts of illustration mcjiggy. Hence this tool(?). It lets you do all of that without headache."
