title = "Shadharon - A Zola Theme"
description = "A simple blog theme made for Zola (the static site generator in Rust). This blog is made using Zola, and I heavily customized a much more simpler theme that lacked a few things. Then the idea came up to make a simple blog theme and thus my struggle with Terra. But I am kind of proud of the theme now. My first ever pull request to a git repository (that was daunting haha) and an open source contribution."
