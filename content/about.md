I am Zayyan. I masquarade as a Pharmacologist when I am not procastinating. I can do that with confidence and flair after graduating with a degree in Pharmacology from Queen Mary University of London. I am somewhat of a web developer now slowly being interested in AI/ML, Arduino/Raspberry Pi tinkerer and sometimes a musician (mainly the guitar and singing off-key these days)
