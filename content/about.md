I am Zayyan. I am doing a PhD on AI Drug Discovery at QMUL. I specifically work with GPCRs, a kind protein in human beings involved in many aspects like inflammation, pain and cell cycle pathways among other things. Interestingly Cannabis works on these specific Cannabinoid Receptors which are a type of GPCRs. My research is centered upon modelling these GPCRs and it's interacting partners in a computational model called graphs. These graphs can in turn be used to all sorts of stuff like predicting if diseases are linked to these GPCRs or any drug could be made to target one of them.

As computer sciencey as my day job sounds, I started with a degree in Pharmacology at QMUL pipetting cells in dimly lit labs and being enamored by biological phenomena. Then I went off to Cambridge where I survived doing an MPhil and fighting imposter syndrome. To be fair I was learning Machine Learning in a lab surrounded by wet lab scientists.

Other than obsessing over my broken code and fighting for Stackoverflow answers I have a collection of hobbies including playing the guitar/bass/piano/embroidery/electronics/tennis albeit all very badly to mediocrely. I might have been part of a hard rock band but why drag embarrassing memories.
